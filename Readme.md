# Datacomp website
Made of 3 main files: \
index.html (home page) \
leaderboard.html \
people.html \
workshop.html \

# Running Locally
You have to create a local server to run locally because of the design of the leaderboard.
I have hard-coded in the port number for now, so you have to do port 8000 or change it in all the 
places it is mentioned in leaderboard.html.

To run the website, navigate into the folder, running


`python3 -m http.server 8000`

and then go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
